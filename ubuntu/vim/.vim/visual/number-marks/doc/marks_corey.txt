1. Visible Mark with number				*marks_corey-intro*

In Vim, mark must use :marks to show where you set mark. Now you can have
commands listed as below to show visible marks and get list like quickfix,
then use :co to get list and jump to its position.

PlaceSign           place a visible mark.
GotoNextSign        go to the next visible mark.
GotoPrevSign        go to the previous visible mark.
RemoveAllSigns      remove all visible marks.
MoveSign            move the mark of the current line to other line.
SaveSigns           save the marks into user defined file.
LoadSigns           load the marks from user defined file.

user defined file is saved under this plugin in the directory 'signs/' with
the suffix ".sign".

The maxium number of marks are 99 becuase of sign limit.

2. Activation						*marks_corey-activate*

You can use this script as a plugin, by copying it to your plugin directory.
See |add-global-plugin| for instructions.  You can also add a line to your
|vimrc| file, such as >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/number-marks/plugin/marks_corey.vim

The command ShowQFList may overwrite the quickfix list from make or your own
quickfix messages. You can't jump by the id or just a key like built-in vim
